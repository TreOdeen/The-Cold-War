<h1><p>What was the importance of the Cold War?</p></h1>
</center>
<center>
<h5><p>The Cold War was important because it split the world into two rival sides that came into conflict with each other in a number of places around the world.  This conflict has left us with, among other things, a huge aresenal of nuclear weapons, particularly in the US and in Russia.

The Cold War caused all sorts of conflicts to occur around the world.  Because of the Cold War, we had the Korean War and the Vietnam War.  Because of the Cold War, we had the Bay of Pigs invasion and the Cuban Missile Crisis.  Because of the Cold War, we had the USSR invading Afghanistan and fighting a war there, which helped to create the Taliban and Al Qaeda.  Because of the Cold War, we had the US helping to overthrow some leaders (Moassadeq in Iran) while propping up other regimes (apartheid regime in South Africa, Pinochet in Chile, Marcos in the Philippines) who really abused their people.

So, the Cold War was important because it caused these sorts of conflicts and these sorts of actions by the US (and by the Soviet Union as well).</p></h5>

<h1><p>The U-2 Spy plane incident</p></h1>
</center>
<center>
<h5><p>An international diplomatic crisis erupted in May 1960 when the USSR (Union of Soviet Socialist Republics) shot down an American U-2 spy plane in Soviet air space and captured its pilot, Francis Gary Powers (1929-77). President Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890-1969) was forced to admit to the Soviets that the U.S. CIA (Central Intelligence Agency) had been flying spy missions over the USSR for several years. The Soviets convicted Powers on espionage charges and sentenced him to 10 years in prison. However, after serving two years, he was released in exchange for a captured Soviet agent in the first-ever U.S. and USSR spy swap. The U-2 spy plane incident raised tensions between the U.S. and the Soviets during the Cold War (1945-1991).</p></h5>

<h1><p>What are the causes of the Cold War?</p></h1>
<h5><p>In summary, the Cold War began in 1945 and was a period of tension between the United States and Soviet Union. President Harry Truman fueled the fire by using the atomic bomb as leverage and issuing the Truman Doctrine to fund democracy in third world nations.</p></h5>
